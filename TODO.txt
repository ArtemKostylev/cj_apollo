TODO: remove journal ui re-render on save      
----------------------------------------------------------
-> Loading animation should be moved to button text instead of table screen.
-> Table interactions should be blocked during save process
-> Table opacity should be lowered during save process

-> Should not refetch after save is done:
  - Some kind of transaction system should be implemented (we make a copy of state object after latest successful save, that
  is immutable until another save success, then, if save failed, we revert object to this state). This also requires all 
  backend operations to be performed in single transaction (If it is not already done in that way).
  - On save error an alert should be shown, containing some text, that is meaningful to a user. (During this task
  some kind of an error mapper should be implemented; this mapper can also be used in fallback screen).

-> after successful save we replace last state, return opacity to the table, turn interactivity on, and show animation of loading
  circle transitioning into check mark for 1 sec, then into normal "save" text.

-> Erasing all user activity on error seems kinda unacceptable. Mb instead we can show some tooltip near save button or change appearance
to indicate, that current progress is unsaved.
